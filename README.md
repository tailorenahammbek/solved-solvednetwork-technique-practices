a program that accepts a series of binary strings and computes the Internet Checksum for them.Each binary string is 4 bits.Total number of binary strings = 4.Total number of binary strings &lt;= 32.Example 1101 0011 1011 1000 equal 0101 accept four four bits 1101 0011 1011 1000 ————- 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 ———– 0 1 0 1a program that accepts a binary string and returns an ASCII art version of the signal diagram for NRZ-L,NRZI, Bipolar-AMI and Pseudoternary encodings. Use + to represent a positive voltage, – to represent anegative voltage and 0 to represent no voltage.Binary string has length = 4.Binary string has length &lt;= 32.NRZ-L; encode 1 as a negative voltage.NRZI; the previous 1 bit was negative.Bipolar-AMI; the previous 1 bit was negative.Pseudoternary; the previous 0 bit was negativeExample Entry 01001101ResultNRZ-L+-++–+-NRZI-+++-++-Bipolar-AMI0+00-+0-Pseudoternary+0-+00-0
